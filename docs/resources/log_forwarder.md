# ghost_log_forwarder (Resource)

A log forwarder receives logs from a Cloud Provider account to be processed in the Ghost platform.

# to assume a role in order to copy logs for processing.
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "assume_role_policy" {
  statement {
    actions = ["sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity"]
    principals {
      type        = "Federated"
      identifiers = ["accounts.google.com"]
    }
    condition {
      test     = "Null"
      variable = "accounts.google.com:sub"
